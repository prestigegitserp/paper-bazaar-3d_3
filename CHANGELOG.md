### Performance
- procedural booth interiors hibernate outside an 11.5m wake radius and fall back to lightweight storefront proxies
- 15.5m sleep hysteresis prevents mount/unmount thrash
- shared 256×128 wear-decal cache replaces repeated high-resolution per-instance decal canvases

## 0.13.0 — Photoreal performance rebuild from v0.12

### Lineage
- rebuilt directly from `release/v0.12.0`
- preserves all release snapshots through v0.12
- experimental post-v0.12 work is not treated as ancestry for this release

### Performance
- static cinematic shadow maps update on scene events rather than every frame
- repeated passage columns and ceiling fixtures use instancing
- removes unnecessary floor geometry subdivisions
- keeps all visible light fixtures while reducing real point-light count
- throttles file-stream distance probes and removes square-root distance work
- freezes local matrices for static authored geometry
- diagnostics frame sampling exists only while F3 is open
- suppresses stationary player-position store writes
- uses ImageBitmap decoding when supported
- serializes GPU texture warm-up during idle time
- adds motion-triggered adaptive DPR so movement gets more frame budget while still frames return to full configured resolution
- warms current shader programs with idle compileAsync and treats warm-up failure as non-blocking
- builds PMREM once per started renderer lifecycle instead of rebuilding it on every quality toggle

### Materials
- adaptive 1K/2K PBR based on quality/device capability
- automatic 2K → 1K fallback
- close-range clearcoat micro-normal detail
- paper/cardboard micro bump and roughness detail
- adds deterministic local paper/cardboard fiber albedo on authored UVs with no extra network request
- uses generated micro roughness during albedo-only PBR phases so close surfaces do not become uniformly glossy/flat while full maps stream
- keeps real PBR normal maps authoritative rather than combining them incorrectly with bump maps

### Interaction safety
- structural meshes remain raycastable as occluders
- only tiny decorative instance batches may opt out of raycast
- semantic hotspot behavior remains unchanged

## 0.12.0 — Progressive loading without visual downgrade

### Startup
- keeps the v0.11 visual/detail stack intact
- Canvas runs demand-mode with reduced intro DPR until the visitor enters
- defers shadow maps, PMREM environment, floor-imperfection canvas and SoftShadows until start
- Catalog Reader is a true interaction-time dynamic import

### File-backed assets
- GLB/scan files prefetch by player distance instead of at page startup
- 24m prefetch / 18m reveal thresholds provide loading headroom
- local Suspense fallback keeps the rest of the world rendered during file decoding
- loaded file assets stay resident to avoid reparse thrash

### GPU / draw calls
- repeated non-interactive authored meshes are consolidated into InstancedMesh groups
- semantic hotspot nodes and transparent glass remain individual and interactive
- no geometry/detail reduction is used

### Textures
- identical PBR variants use ref-counted shared residency
- PBR texture-set builds are capped at two concurrent jobs
- critical passage albedo can load early; noncritical materials are staggered
- Cinematic normal/roughness upgrades are scheduled after interaction/idle time
- procedural fallback variants are shared by surface/repeat/anisotropy key


## 0.11.0 — Geometry + surface realism

### Authored GLB v3
- fixes a critical realism gap: authored geometry now exports UV coordinates

### Local detail layer
- adds asset-specific detail profiles keyed by stable assetId

### Architecture
- keeps semantic node hotspots, independent colliders and RuntimeBundle repositories
- visual skin remains replaceable without changing Catalog/Document/server contracts


## 0.8.0 — Authored GLB shop + scoped world labels

### Authored asset pipeline
- first deterministic, file-backed authored shop in the live World

### Interaction / Digital Twin
- adds `node` hotspot anchors for GLB and GLTF scan rooms
- renderer attaches semantic interactions to cloned named model nodes
- retains point hotspots as a fallback

### Materials
- adds network-safe PBR surface registry with procedural fallback
- integrates 1K CC0 Poly Haven materials for worn brick, worn plaster, worn tile floor, painted metal shutter and plywood
- Cinematic loads color + normal + roughness maps; Balanced keeps a lighter path
- PBR failures never crash the room and fall back to generated textures

### Architecture
- preserves RuntimeBundle, semantic interactions, scan/GLB renderer boundary and document reader
- world layout and colliders updated for the narrower alley and new glass-counter orientation
- v0.7 remains server/CMS-ready and does not encode business data into renderer components

## 0.6.0 — Modular retail experience + interactive catalogs

### Retail realism
- six distinct booth profiles instead of one shared shop layout
- procedural surface registry for plaster, wood, aged brick, terrazzo, paper, fabric and brushed metal

### Interaction
- physical catalog prop on each vendor desk
- new semantic `document` interaction independent from renderer meshes
- responsive two-page catalog reader with keyboard navigation and mobile single-page mode
- generated product pages, paper swatches, store story and source/contact pages

### Architecture
- Runtime repository contracts for Catalog, World and Documents
- runtime bundle loader with API-first catalog + seed fallback
- World and Documents promoted to app state; HUD and scene no longer import demoWorld directly
- booth instance config now references stable profile IDs so server data can select renderer behavior without embedding React logic

### Digital Twin path
- scan/GLB renderer boundary remains intact
- procedural surface IDs can later map to CDN-hosted PBR/KTX2 assets without changing booth templates

## 0.5.0 — Tehran paper alley + mobile controls

### Environment
- expands the world from 4 rooms to 6 shops/spaces
- replaces the glossy exhibition-hall mood with a narrower Tehran paper-market alley
- adds warm plaster/brick materials, arch ribs, Persian shop signs, awnings and dense paper shelves
- adds Seraj Cellulose as an additional sourced vendor
- keeps one dedicated scan-ready room for the first real GLB/LiDAR experiment

### Camera / interaction
- mouse wheel zoom now changes camera FOV inside the 3D world instead of relying on browser zoom
- two-finger pinch and mobile +/- buttons control the same camera zoom
- key 0 resets camera zoom
- mobile virtual joystick, touch-look zone, interact and reset controls
- mobile movement remains collision-aware and uses the same world/navigation contracts as desktop

### Performance
- mobile/coarse-pointer devices start in Balanced mode automatically
- lower mobile DPR and shadows disabled in Balanced mode
- repeated shelves, paper bundles, arch ribs and floor marks use instancing
- removes the expensive mirrored aisle from the default market skin
- fewer real-time lights while preserving emissive fixtures and warm visual contrast

### Versioning / deployment
- release/v0.3.0 and release/v0.4.0 snapshot branches preserve previous milestones
- main remains the latest stable release line
- every push/merge to main builds and deploys the latest version once GitHub Pages is enabled once in repository Settings
